# Canteen BITD - Online Food Ordering System Project

Welcome to Canteen BITD - an innovative and comprehensive online food ordering and management system tailored for Birla Institute of Technology. In response to the challenges faced by canteens, messes, and cafeterias dealing with high volumes of customers during peak hours, we've developed a sophisticated solution to streamline the entire process. Our web-based application is designed to alleviate the inefficiencies of traditional ordering and delivery systems by allowing registered users to place their food orders in advance, with the added convenience of online payments. The user-friendly interface enables individuals to select their preferred delivery time slots, optimizing both user experience and operational efficiency.

- **Diverse Store Sections:** The canteen is efficiently divided into three sections catering to students, faculty, and other visitors, each with its distinct menu and offerings.
- **Advanced Order Placement:** Authenticated users can explore section-specific menus, select desired food items, specify quantities, and effortlessly add them to their virtual cart.
- **Order Tracking and History:** Users have the ability to track their order status and review past orders, facilitating transparency and order management.
- **Empowering Admin and Store Owners:** Administrators and store owners enjoy elevated privileges, including inventory management, menu updates, order processing, and comprehensive administrative control.
